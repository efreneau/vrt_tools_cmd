* Break out some code from process to new class InputStream

# Future
* No idea to byte swap all words in a packet, just header, fields, body, context
* Capitalize letters in strings more consistently
* Format integer and fractional second timestamps in both fields and context section nicely
* Format timestamp adjustment more nicely
* Format calibration time more nicely
* Add skip/seek and count for time as well
* Add option that assumes all packets are the same size
* Display body data in some way?
