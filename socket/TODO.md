* Add sample support. For this, sample size in B is needed. Then, number of samples can be calculated, time length with regard to the samples in the last packet and so on. You should be able to supply sample size in B, or read it from IF context.
* Add looping option?
* Check that time stamps don't go backwards
* Add TCP support?
* Send to multiple addresses?
* Cannot rerun directly after running. Use SO_REUSEADDR?
